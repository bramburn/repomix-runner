    <!-- Fluent UI React Components -->
    <!-- Note: Using a CDN for Fluent UI v9 is tricky as it's distributed as modules.
         We will mock the styling behavior or try to bundle it.
         However, for this verification, since we are testing *styling refactoring*,
         we need the actual styling library to be active or at least the classes generated.

         Since we cannot easily serve the actual React app with webpack dev server here without setting up a lot of things,
         and the user wants to verify *frontend*, we have a limitation.

         The user code uses `makeStyles` which generates classes at runtime.
         If we can build the app and serve the built `index.html` (if it exists) or `App.js`, that would be better.

         The build command `npm run compile` generates `dist/webview.js` (presumably from esbuild config).
         Let's check `esbuild.js` to see where the webview code goes.
